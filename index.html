			<h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Alex and I am a recent college graduate from Oregon State Univeristy with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Computer Science seeking career opportunities that would further improve my software development capabilities and provide me with practical industry experience.</p>
			<p>My programming experience is focused toward C/C++ with the use of standard graphics libraries such as OpenGL and GLSL. Through my many years in academia I have also been exposed to Python, Rust, Assembly, LUA, web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, and SQL, and app development using Flutter and Dart.</p>
			<p>My goal for a career is to be a video game software developer, creating interesting game mechanics or even building whole game engines. I have worked with game development software such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4/5, and older software such as GameMaker. Using these softwares I have made multiple projects, some of which can be found on my GitHub, and some that I have lost track of due to how long ago they were made.</p>
			<p>Along with my desire to be a game developer, I am also an avid gamer and enjoy spending my free time playing video games. My preferred genre is city-management/base-building, although I probably spend more time playing survival RPGs and first-person shooters.</p>
